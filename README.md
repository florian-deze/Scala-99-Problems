# Scala-99-Problems
 This project is used in order to train myself in programming in Scala
 All those problems can be found on the website : http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99/
 Some resolution can be found on this website too, but I tried to find others answers.
 On purpose I write some function even if they already exist in Scala.
 The Order of difficulty is "." which is simple (around 15 minutes to resolve) to "..." which is the most difficult and can take few hours or more to find a good solution. 

 Problem 1 "." : Find the last element of a list

 Problem 2 "." : Find the last but one element of a list.

 Problem 3 "." : Find the Kth element of a list

 Problem 4 "." : Find the number of elements of a list

 Problem 5 "." : Reverse a list

 Problem 6 "." : Find out whether a list is a palindrome

 Problem 7 ".." : Flatten a nested list structure
