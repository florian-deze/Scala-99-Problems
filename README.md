# Scala-99-Problems
 This project is used in order to train myself in programming in Scala
 All those problems can be found on the website : http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99/
 Some resolution can be found on this website too, but I tried to find others answers.
 On purpose I write some function even if they already exist in Scala.
 The Order of difficulty is (*) which is simple (around 15 minutes to resolve) to (***) which is the most difficult and can take few hours or more to find a good solution. 

 Problem 1 : Find the last element of a list

 Problem 2 : Find the last but one element of a list.

 Problem 3 : Find the Kth element of a list

 Problem 4 : Find the number of elements of a list

 Problem 5 : Reverse a list

 Problem 6 : Find out whether a list is a palindrome

 Problem 7 : Flatten a nested list structure
